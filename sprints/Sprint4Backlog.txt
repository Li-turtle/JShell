//Sprint 3 Backlog.
July 17st to July 23th

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I can redirect stdout to overwrite files so that I can check the output later.
b) As a user, I can redirect stdout to append to files so that I can check the merged output later.
c) As a user, I can remove directories from file system so that I can get the file system organized.
d) As a user, I can create multiple directories at one so that I can organize my file system faster.
e) As a user, I can recursively display the content of files and directories so that I can know what is inside the directory.
f) As a user, I can move file to a new location so that I can have a cleaner file system.
