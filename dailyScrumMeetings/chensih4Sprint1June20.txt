What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finish the initial version of Command and Mkdir

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish the parts for various exceptions (for Mkdir)
        - exceptions on invalid arguments/data structure and the like
    - replenish the crcCards

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need unified Exceptions for our group to continue on the exceptions part for JShell, Command, etc.
