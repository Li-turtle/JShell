What did I work on in the last three days?
    - figure out how to use free TTS library
    - using free TTS to speak a single string
    - make speak able to speak multiple lines and treat QUIT as a end mark

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - test speak command
    - read teammates' code and figure how their code works
    

Am I blocked on anything?
